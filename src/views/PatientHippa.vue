                The terms of the notice may change, if so, you will be notified at your next visit to update your signature/date.
                You have the right to restrict how your protected health information is used and disclosed for treatment, payment or healthcare
                operations. We are not required to agree with this restriction, but if we do, we shall honor this agreement. The HIPAA (Health
                Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) law allows for the use of the information for treatment, payment, or

                be retroactive.
